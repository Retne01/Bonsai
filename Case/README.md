# Bonsai
This is a layered acrylic case design for the Bonsai.  I currently have this ordered from Ponoko but I don't have it in hand yet.  Use this at your own risk.

If you order this from Ponoko here are the material types and thicknesses to use:
01 - Bonsai-Top1-2mm - As the file name suggests use 2mm acrylic.
02 - Bonsai-Top2-3mm - 3mm acrylic
03 - Bonsai-Top3-3mm - 3mm acrylic
04 - Bonsai-Plate-1-5mm - 1.5mm Delrin.  This can be black or white.
05 - Bonsai-BottomOpen-4-5mm - 4.5mm acrylic
06 - Bonsai-BottomClosedwFeet-3mm - 3mm acrylic
07 - Bonsai-Bottom03mm - 3mm acrylic

You will also need [10 M2.5 15mm standoffs](https://www.harwin.com/products/R25-1001502/), [4 M2.5 12mm standoffs](https://www.harwin.com/products/R25-1001202/), [M2 4mm nuts](https://www.harwin.com/products/M80-2430000B/), and [14 M2.5 5mm screws](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Plated-Phillips-M2-5-0-45-Threads/dp/B000NHVPPO/).  The screws may need to be 6mm.  I won't know until I get the cut case in hand.
